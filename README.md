WORKSHOP: Collecting and Analyzing Social Media Data with R
=============

This github repository contains the materials and slides that I prepared for the 2-hour workshop on social media data analysis I gave at Georgetown University on February 2nd, 2015.

The purpose of the workshop was to provide an overview of the available tools to interact with the APIs of the three most popular social media websites - Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram - and to illustrate potential applications of this data relevant to the social sciences.

It was structured in four different parts. I started by motivating why social scientists should pay attention to social media as a new source of data about human behavior, and as a new communication tool with a large impact on different political phenomena. I offered examples of recent publications that illustrate each approach, including some of my own research.
